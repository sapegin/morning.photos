Hello, my name is Artem, and I make photos of trees, buildings, and things. For more than 20 years since I picked up photography as a hobby, I couldn’t settle on a single genre or style. It used to bother me, but I learned to accept it.

I equally enjoy taking quick snaps with my iPhone and standing for an hour beside my big camera on a tripod, watching the light change during sunrise or sunset. I love bright pictures with _a lo-fi beach city vibe_, and I love sombre cinematic images of _a quite desperation_. My own mood usually leans to the former, but the aesthetics of sadness and decay attract me in art, cinema, and music.
